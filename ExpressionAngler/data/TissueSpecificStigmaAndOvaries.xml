			<li>Stigma and ovary tissues were isolated from pistils after emasculating stage 8 buds of Landsberg erecta (Ler) flowers. After 1 day of growth, pistils were harvested and frozen in liquid N2. </li>
			<li>Stigmas were then separated from pistils using superfine scissors. Stigmas and the remaining ovaries were placed in separate tubes on dry ice until collections were complete</li>
			<li>Samples were taken in duplicate: average shown</li>
			<li>RNA was isolated and hybridized to the ATH1 chip</li>
			<li>Data normalized by GCOS/MAS5, TGT 100</li>
