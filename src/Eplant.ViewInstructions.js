"Chromosome Viewer":"The Chromosome Viewer shows where genes are situated on chromosomes.",
"Interaction Viewer":"The Interactions Viewer displays protein interactors from our database of 70,944 predicted and 36,306 confirmed interacting proteins for the currently selected gene product.",
"World eFP":'The World eFP Viewer displays natural variation of gene expression levels from ecotypes collected from around the world.',
"Plant eFP" :"The Plant eFP Viewer displays the currently selected gene's expression levels in various tissues.",
"Cell eFP":"The Cell eFP Viewer depicts subcellular localization of a gene product. The color gradient represents quality of localization information from the SUBA database.",
"Molecule Viewer":"This view displays the 3D molecular structure of the protein associated with the selected gene. Highlight functionally important regions identified in the PFAM and CDD databases, or select an amino acid residue to highlight it on the protein structure.",
"Sequence Viewer":"This is an implementation of JBrowse, a genome browser that lets you explore sequence data from a broad overview all the way down to individual nucleotides. Zoom in and out of your selected gene to explore binding sites, polymorhpisms and other gene features provided by Araport.",
"Experimental Viewer":"The Tissue & Experiment eFP Viewer displays the results of numerous gene expression profiling experiments. Select a view by clicking on a thumbnail.",
"Heat Map Viewer":"This Heat Map displays the expression levels across 350+ samples of all genes that are loaded, along with the corresponding subcellular localizations of the gene products. Hover over a heat map cell to see associated metadata. Click on a sample to open the relevant eFP Viewer.",
"Welcome Screen":"Select a gene with the box on the left, or use the Expression Angler to describe an expression pattern and find genes that match it.",
"Linkout Options":"View the selected gene with a dynamic link-out to other bioinformatic tools. Tools will open in a new browser tab."
