The predicted interactions (interologs) were generated by Drs Matt Geisler and Jane Geisler-Lee at the Southern Illinois University. Their current version is Interactome 2.0. The confirmed Arabidopsis interacting proteins come from BIND, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, from high-density Arabidopsis protein microarrays (Popescu et al., 2007; Popescu et al., 2009), from Braun et al.'s Arabidopsis Interactome 2011 , from Wolf Frommer's Membrane protein INteractome Database MIND, and over 1190 other literature sources. The interactions in BIND were identified using several different methods, such as yeast two hybrid screens, but also via traditional biochemical methods. Use the links to BIND/MIND/AI/PubMed records that are in the output of this viewer to view further information. All subcellular localisation data is from SUBA, the Arabidopsis Subcellular Database (Tanz et al., 2013, Nucleic Acids Research 41:D1185-91). These localisations do not include predicted localisations. Additional protein function data is from MapMan (Timm et al., 2004, The Plant Journal, 37:914).",
